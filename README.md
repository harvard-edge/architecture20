**Architecture 2.0** is the engineering discipline of using AI, grounded in
architectural representations, tools, and experiments, to formulate, explore,
implement, evaluate, explain, and defend computer architecture decisions. This
public research and teaching project develops that discipline through a
synthesis lecture, companion labs, community resources, and a versioned
design-loop card.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Work in progress.** This material is under active development.
> Arguments, terminology, examples, labs, and machine-readable interfaces may
> change as evidence and reader feedback improve. Tagged releases are stable
> snapshots; if you cite or build on the project, record the version you used.
> Corrections and technically grounded disagreement are welcome.

AI can assist across an architecture study, from framing a question and
constructing alternatives to testing mechanisms and defending a bounded
recommendation. A design loop organizes that work around architectural state,
tool feedback, evidence, and human judgment. The card records the question,
inputs, tool runs, results, and decision for one study; it does not define the
field.

Architecture 2.0 is part of the [mlsysbook.ai](https://mlsysbook.ai) family.

## Participate

The project accepts proposed tools, readings, workshops, corrections, and
examples through structured GitHub forms. Maintainers review each proposal
before it becomes part of a public registry.

[All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) convention.

## Project Surfaces

The public site connects the following maintained surfaces.

| Surface | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Synthesis lecture** | Develops the discipline of using AI to formulate, explore, implement, evaluate, explain, and defend computer architecture decisions. |
| **Design-loop card** | A versioned twelve-field review record with machine-checkable claims, evidence, independent profiles, replay, and decision rights. |
| **Companion labs** | A separate tool-backed practice path for producing evidence and replayable run archives without replacing the synthesis lecture's executed study. |
| **Tool registry** | A maintained index of simulators, proxy models, verification harnesses, benchmarks, datasets, and data representations, each tied to a role in an architecture design loop. |
| **Reading list** | A curated path through papers, SIGARCH posts, talks, datasets, and workshop writeups. |
| **Workshop archive** | Verified active calls when available, with prior events retained as an archive. |
| **Discussions** | A public place to propose questions and ideas when durable discussion is useful. |

## Repository Guide

| Path | What it contains |
| --- | --- |
| [`book/`](book/) | Quarto source for the synthesis lecture, including chapters, appendices, figures, and references. |
| [`labs/`](labs/) | Tool-backed exercises, the executed study, replay support, and tests. |
| [`design-loop-card/`](design-loop-card/) and [`schemas/`](schemas/) | Human-readable templates and machine-checkable contracts for recording a study. |
| [`examples/`](examples/) | Completed cards and supporting evidence that show how the contracts are used. |
| [`www/`](www/) and [`tools/`](tools/) | Source for the project site, community resources, and tool registry. |
| [`data/source-receipts/`](data/source-receipts/) and [`compliance/`](compliance/) | Source notes, permissions records, and publication checks. |

The repository is developed in public so that claims, examples, interfaces,
and teaching material can be inspected and improved together. A tagged release
captures a reviewed snapshot; work on the development branch may change before
the next tag.
