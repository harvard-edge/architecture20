# Awesome Architecture 2.0 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of tools, simulators, proxies, and agentic workflows that enable
**Architecture 2.0**: the shift toward auditable AI-assisted computing-system
design loops grounded in computer architecture.

This is the living registry accompanying the book [*Architecture 2.0: Designing AI-Assisted Loops for Computing Systems*](https://arch2.mlsysbook.ai).

## How to Contribute

If you have built an open-source tool, surrogate model, verification harness,
benchmark, dataset, or agentic loop, use the
[Submit a tool form](https://github.com/harvard-edge/arch2/issues/new?template=submit_tool.yml)
to get it reviewed for the registry. Strong submissions describe where the tool
fits in a design loop and include optional visibility metadata such as authors,
institutions, paper links, artifact status, and an example loop.
