# Architecture 2.0 Labs

These ten chapter-aligned activities provide selected, deterministic practice
in AI-assisted computer architecture. Learners formulate bounded study records,
inspect alternatives, connect configurations to a real simulator, evaluate
evidence, explain selected results, and defend limited decisions. The design
loop organizes execution and analysis in these activities; it is not the whole
discipline or its intended outcome.

The chapter activities require no live AI model. Their runnable course example
records `model_calls = 0` and uses fixed heuristic, human-seeded, and
negative-control candidates so that every learner can inspect the same evidence
without an API key or network dependency. The separate Chapter 8 study records
one real, bounded model interaction and compares it with a deterministic
conventional heuristic at the same SCALE-Sim budget. Its complete response and
provenance are committed, so the required replay remains network-free. An
optional live adapter can produce a new proposal without overwriting the book's
result. The recorded comparison is a single trace, not evidence that AI
generally improves architecture work.

The complete activity map, expected duration, and output of each lab are in
[`notebooks/README.md`](notebooks/README.md).

These activities are formative rather than a complete summative assessment.
Lab 08 integrates a supplied task, candidate set, environment, evidence path,
and decision record. The transfer capstone defined in
[Chapter 10](../book/chapters/10-what-architect-owns/index.qmd) instead gives the
learner a new, tractable architecture problem and assesses all six capabilities
as one bounded study. The activity map shows which parts of that larger outcome
the current labs practice.

## Learner Setup

Use Python 3.10 or 3.11 on a laptop. The tested environment pins SCALE-Sim
3.0.0 and NumPy below version 2.

```bash
cd labs
python3.11 -m venv ../.venv
../.venv/bin/python -m pip install \
  -c constraints/py311-linux.txt \
  -e ".[dev,notebook]"
../.venv/bin/python -m pip check
```

For Python 3.10, use `constraints/py310-linux.txt` instead. The constraint files
record the tested Linux environments. Other operating systems use the same
declared package versions but may resolve platform-specific wheels differently.

Start with the first activity in edit mode so your responses remain available
during the session:

```bash
../.venv/bin/marimo edit notebooks/lab_01_prompt_to_card.py
```

Use `marimo run` for a read-only classroom deployment. Lab 06, the primary
simulator-backed activity, lives with its packaged example:

```bash
../.venv/bin/marimo edit examples/scale_proxy_mirage/lab.py
```

Every activity begins with retrieval and a submitted prediction. Evidence stays
hidden until the required response is complete. Later activities inspect or
produce cards, supporting evidence records, failed-run and rejected-alternative
records, environment records, and replayable run archives.

The Chapter 8 activity practices the same evidence and decision mechanics used
by the recorded study. The chapter retains a short illustrative lighthouse
prelude, then centers the real model-plus-SCALE-Sim comparison. The constructed
prelude and computed simulator evidence remain explicitly separate.

## Recorded Chapter 8 Study

The study protocol, complete model record, raw SCALE-Sim summary reports, and
replay instructions are in
[`examples/ai_systolic_array_study/`](examples/ai_systolic_array_study/). Its
recorded outcome is a null architecture result, an AI-versus-heuristic tie, and
a falsified model-proposed mechanism. That adverse result is retained rather
than reframed as a model success.

## Run-Archive Workflow

For this course exercise, the simulator runner deliberately stops with a schema
2.0 card whose inspectability, disclosure, and decision-right profiles are
complete, whose replay profile is partial with verified bindings, and whose
decision remains pending. A learner must
inspect the machine recommendation and evidence, supply a decision, and
validate the resealed run archive. The independent-review profile remains
`not_claimed`; recording a decision does not pretend that the learner reviewed
their own work independently. The interactive Lab 06 and Lab 08 activities
guide this transition.

The command-line equivalent is useful for instructors and reproducibility jobs:

```bash
../.venv/bin/python -m arch2_labs.scale_env \
  --example scale_proxy_mirage \
  --out /tmp/arch2_proxy_mirage_run
# Inspect recommendation.json, evidence_record.json, and raw reports first.
../.venv/bin/python -m arch2_labs.decisions \
  /tmp/arch2_proxy_mirage_run \
  examples/scale_proxy_mirage/human_decision.example.yaml
../.venv/bin/python -m arch2_labs.validators \
  /tmp/arch2_proxy_mirage_run
```

`human_decision.example.yaml` is a separate decision record and a
named course-staff fixture for automated reproduction. It is not the learner
assignment and must not be presented as the learner's judgment.

A complete course run archive contains a hash-sealed manifest, canonical
design-loop card, environment contract, candidates, raw simulator provenance
and output hashes, `evidence_record.json`, failed-run and
rejected-alternative records, a noncommitting machine recommendation, and a
separate decision record. Validation checks archive integrity, cross-record
candidate identities, the declared decision scope, and the
separation between recommendation and decision.

## Instructor Judgment

The validator checks declared profiles, typed claims and evidence, decision
rights, cross-record identities, integrity bindings, the authorized decision
scope, and separation of the machine recommendation from the decision. A
passing run archive has internally consistent records and valid local hashes. It is
not proof that the architecture reasoning is correct or that the learner has
mastered the six capabilities.

After validation, assess the learner's record with the following judgment
rubric. Use the rows together rather than adding field-presence points.

| **Dimension** | **Weak** | **Adequate** | **Strong** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Study formulation | Repeats a prompt or leaves the baseline, constraints, or claim implicit. | Bounds the task, baseline, alternatives, constraints, claim, and commitment limit. | Also makes non-goals, assumptions, and evidence that would count against the claim precise. |
| Alternatives and implementation path | Accepts a supplied winner or reports a tool result without a traceable artifact. | Connects declared alternatives to checkable configurations, tool inputs, outputs, provenance, and rejected candidates. | Also justifies the method and tool path, preserves serious alternatives, and identifies where the implementation path could invalidate the study. |
| Evaluation and explanation | Reports a metric or repeats the notebook's explanation. | Matches evidence to workload, baseline, fidelity, and scope, then gives a plausible architecture mechanism. | Tests that mechanism with a sensitivity, intervention, ablation, or discriminating contrast, addresses counterevidence, and uses a matched no-AI comparison when claiming benefit from AI. |
| Decision and defense | Names a winner without ownership, tradeoffs, or limits. | Gives an evidence-bounded recommendation with rationale, owner, residual risk, and reversal condition. | Can answer an independent challenge, distinguish judgment from tool output, and revise the recommendation when assumptions or evidence change. |

The downloadable records capture the prediction, inspected evidence, and
bounded disposition appropriate to each activity. The final transfer reflection
is currently session-local and is not included in the downloaded artifact, so
instructors who grade it must collect it separately. The open-ended Chapter 10
capstone remains the assessment of independent transfer across all six
capabilities.

## Verification

From `labs/`, run:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
marimo check --strict \
  examples/scale_proxy_mirage/lab.py \
  notebooks/lab_*.py
```

CI runs the suite under both supported Python versions, builds the wheel and
source distribution, and smoke-tests the installed wheel outside the checkout.

## Troubleshooting

- Run commands from `labs/` so the local package and example paths resolve.
- Confirm `python --version` reports 3.10 or 3.11.
- Run `python -m pip check` after installation.
- Treat a simulator crash as an environment failure to diagnose. It is not a
  candidate rejection unless a declared rule explicitly makes it disqualifying.
- Keep generated run archives outside the repository unless they are intentional,
  reviewed fixtures.
